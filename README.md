# CryptoBudget

A project created with students from WIT.  It's a budgeting application written in Java.  We wanted to implement some cryptocurrency
features, so there is a cryptocurrency price tracker.  There's also an optical-character recognition receipt scanner, a web scraper, 
and some other fun utilities in here.
